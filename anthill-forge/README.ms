# Anthill Forge

Anthill Forge contains training scripts for fine-tuning language models using
datasets produced by Anthill Loom.

### Inputs
- `pairs.jsonl` or Hugging Face datasets

### Outputs
- Fine-tuned models (e.g. Phi-2 derivatives)

Forge is intentionally model-agnostic and focuses on reproducible training.
