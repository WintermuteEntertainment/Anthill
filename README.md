The Ants Go Marching One by One...

**Anthill** is an end-to-end system for turning real ChatGPT conversations into high-quality instruction datasets and fine-tuned language models.

It consists of three modular components:

- **Anthill Spider** — a browser extension that safely extracts ChatGPT conversations
- **Anthill Loom** — a Python pipeline that converts conversations into training-ready datasets
- **Anthill Forge** — model training scripts for fine-tuning instruction-following LLMs

Designed for transparency, reproducibility, and scale.
